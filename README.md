# CPEG 676 - Secure Software Design

This repo will contain the code I create while working on CPEG676 @ UDEL.
Like most of my programming work, this is a combination of my own work, and things I have found on the internet and attempted to make work my way.

I am by no means a legitimate programmer, so if you choose to use any of this, do so at your own risk. This repo is largely to be able to provide relatively easy access to my code for interested parties.
